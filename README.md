# Senior Seminar
As a student taking this math course, I am required to produce a paper of at least 15 pages (but no more than 25 pages, including the bibliography) on a math topic approved by my instructor. I can either choose a topic from the list of suggested topics available on Canvas or propose my own. It is important to have my topic approved by email no later than 01/31 to ensure it is suitable.

To prepare my paper, I am strongly recommended to use LaTeX and produce a typed pdf document. Additional resources and recommendations on how to prepare my paper are available on Canvas. It is crucial to keep in mind that papers are due on Thursday, 03/16, by 5 pm, and my instructor will not accept late work.

I am encouraged to discuss my topic and paper with my instructor several times before submitting it to ensure that I have ample time to make any necessary changes. Therefore, I need to have an outline ready and meet with the instructor early enough in the process to allow for feedback and adjustments. Thank you for reading!
